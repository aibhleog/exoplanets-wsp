ORDER OF NOTEBOOKS:
-------------------

Day 1:  introduction_to_python

Day 2:  generating_fake_data
        generating_fake_lightcurves
		
Day 3:  fake_exoplanet_data

Day 4:  fake_exoplanet_data-2

Day 5:  analyzing_kepler_lightcurves
        exploring_kepler_database
		
		
Run through the notebooks in this order.  If the students don't get through a notebook the day it's shared with them, starting with that notebook the following day (to finish it up before moving on) is totally fine.

On the final day (Day 5) they will also need to make their presentation and ideally practice AT LEAST once -- so leave the "exploring_kepler_database" notebook as an activity they can do on their own (unless yall are really efficient and have time for it, in which case have fun!).
